# waveDiffraction
Python code simulating single slit wave diffraction.

This code use matplotlib library to visualize the wave diffraction.

waveDiffraction.py are program to show a visualization about wave that go through a single slit then produce a wave diffraction, and waveDiffraction.py are program that show a slice of the propagation of wave diffraction which show an interference pattern.
